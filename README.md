# bca - Binary Chroma Animation

BCA is a file format for time/frame based animations for Razer Chroma enabled devices.

A `.bca` file contains data for each frame wrapped in a package containing:

- a frame header
- a device header for each device in this frame
- color data with row/column asignment for the specific device

> For reading and playing these animations there is a C# project which uses [Colore](https://github.com/CoraleStudios/Colore).
